# gol - conway's game of life

version: 0.2.2

gol is an implementation of conway's game of life that runs in a terminal emulator.
there are two states: alive and dead, and each generation uses the number of neighbors
to determine the state of each cell. a dead cell surrounded by exactly 3 live cells will
spawn. a live cell will stay alive if it is surrounded by 2 or 3 other cells, otherwise it
dies. each generation uses the last generations map to create the next map.

### build and install:
    $ make && sudo make install

### usage:
    run gol with base parameters:
        $ gol
    change size of map:
        $ gol -x [columns] -y [rows]
    use ascii only mode:
        $ gol -a
    change initial distribution weight:
        $ gol -w [int]
    change time interval between steps:
        $ gol -t [ms]
    use a file as input:
        $gol -f [file]
    
when using a file as input, gol uses any non-whitespace character as a live cell. if the given
file is larger than the map, gol will simply fit what it can on the map.

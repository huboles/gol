gol - Conway's Game Of Life

Version: 0.2.2

gol is an implementation of Conway's Game of life that runs in a terminal emulator.
There are two states: alive and dead, and each generation uses the number of neighbors
to determine the state of each cell. A dead cell surrounded by exactly 3 live cells will
spawn. A live cell will stay alive if it is surrounded by 2 or 3 other cells, otherwise it
dies. Each generation uses the last generations map to create the next map.

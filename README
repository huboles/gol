gol - Conway's Game Of Life

Version: 0.2.2

gol is an implementation of Conway's Game of life that runs in a terminal emulator.
There are two states: alive and dead, and each generation uses the number of neighbors
to determine the state of each cell. A dead cell surrounded by exactly 3 live cells will
spawn. A live cell will stay alive if it is surrounded by 2 or 3 other cells, otherwise it
dies. Each generation uses the last generations map to create the next map.


Installation:

Download and extract source:
    $ curl "https://download.huck.website/gol-[VERSION].tar.gz > gol.tar.gz
    $ tar -xzvf gol.tar.gz >
    $ cd gol

Build and install:
    $ make && sudo make install


Usage:

    Run gol with base parameters:
        $ gol
    Change size of map:
        $ gol -x [COLUMNS] -y [ROWS]
    Use ascii only mode:
        $ gol -a
    Change initial distribution weight:
        $ gol -w [INT]
    Change time interval between steps:
        $ gol -t [ms]
    Use a file as input:
        $gol -f [file]
    
When using a file as input, gol uses any non-whitespace character as a live cell. If the given
file is larger than the map, gol will simply fit what it can on the map.
